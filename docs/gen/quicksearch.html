Getting up and running Clone this repo from https://github.com/WEREMSOFT/HTML5SellGame.git Run npm install from the root directory Run gulp Your browser will automatically be opened and directed to the browser-sync proxy address ###How The Game Works The Shell Game, involves a flat surface, a row of three small containers and a ball small enough to fit underneath each of them. On each turn of the game the player is shown the ball being placed under one of the containers before the order of the containers is repeatedly shuffled at random. The player then has to guess correctly which container the ball is under in order to win, otherwise they lose. Highlights All code writen by myself except by node_modules Uses Gulp for build tasks Uses watch to re-run scripts if a file changes. Uses browser-sync to reload or inject changed files.
