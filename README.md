#How The Game Works

The Shell Game, involves a flat surface, a row of three small

containers and a ball small enough to fit underneath each of

them.

On each turn of the game the player is shown the ball being

placed under one of the containers before the order of the

containers is repeatedly shuffled at random.

The player then has to guess correctly which container the ball is

under in order to win, otherwise they lose.
